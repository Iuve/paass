Make InitMap happen during initialization so that only necessary histograms
are created
Incorporate changes necessary for Pixie-500 data (MAJOR)
Update statistics analysis
Throw in some commonly used scripts
Add support for subsubtypes throughout?
Make the damm IDs in GeProcessor have some semblance of organization.
Fix the memory leak in GeProcessor.cpp/ConstructAddback function.
48-bit times in RawEvent
ROOT histogramming
Smarter (magic) dependency checking
Adjust analyzers so the double trace analyzers find each fast filter crossing
self-consistently.
Find a cogent way to set the analyzer level using "trace" parameter from map.txt
Complain a little bit more bitterly when encountering a wrong vsn other than 9999 in the data stream.
Adjust the contraction so the calibration parameters from the raw spectra are appropriate.

For Redhat systems, libstdc++.so.5 is necessary to compile with ROOT support. Compilation needs to be streamlined in this case.
